# Suicide-Risk-Detection-with-Deep-Learning

This project presents a NLP based approach to contribute to
the identification of suicidal tendencies in texts written on online forums.
We used deep learning approaches such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM, RNN, and
GRU, and ensemble learning such as XGBoost, and Random Forest in
a Reddit dataset. The model can analyze texts and categorize them ac-
cording to whether they are suicidal or not. GRU was shown to be the
most effective model with an accuracy of 93.25%.
